# Explain Docker Containers vs VMs
VM is hardaware level virtualization whereas Containers are OS level virtualization.
VM has own hardware & OS unlike containers where hardware is shared and host OS kernel but can have own OS.
VM has a full copy of OS therefore takes tons of space  while containers are isolated end up in taking less space.
